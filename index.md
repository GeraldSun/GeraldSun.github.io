## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where I am part of the [UW-BioNLP Group](https://depts.washington.edu/bionlp/index.html), mentored by [Dr. Meliha Yetisgen](https://faculty.washington.edu/melihay/). My current research focuses on applying large language models (LLMs) to medical question answering and error detection in clinical notes. I earned a B.S. in Chemistry from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) and a M.S. in Health Informatics from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). While at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/), under the mentorship of [Dr. Yifan Peng](https://pengyifan.com/), I focused on evaluating LLMs on various clinical tasks, including radiology report generation, and evidence summarization. I am also interested in multimodal deep learning with biomedical images and text. My research goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of natural language processing techniques in clinical domains.
