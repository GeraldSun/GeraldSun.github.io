## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Washington, where I am part of the UW-BioNLP Group, mentored by Dr. Meliha Yetisgen. My current research focuses on applying large language models (LLMs) to medical question answering and error detection in clinical notes. I earned a B.S. in Chemistry from Nanjing University and a M.S. in Health Informatics from Cornell University. While at Weill Cornell Medicine, under the mentorship of Dr. Yifan Peng, I focused on evaluating LLMs on various clinical tasks, including radiology report generation, and evidence summarization. I am also interested in multimodal deep learning with biomedical images and text. My research goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of natural language processing techniques in clinical domains.
